# Feynman-AI

This is a tool to help learners practice explaining concepts using the Feynman learning technique along with AI assessment.

## Description

Feynman-AI allows users to input a concept from a textbook and then type out an explanation of the concept in their own words. The explanation is run through an AI engine which analyzes the text and provides feedback:

- Assesses coverage of the core aspects of the concept
- Checks for clarity and simplicity of the explanation
- Identifies gaps in understanding and areas that need improvement
- Provides a score on how well the concept was explained

The goal is to help learners practice breaking down complex ideas simply, finding gaps in understanding, and iterating to build fluency in explaining concepts from first principles.

## Usage

1. Enter a concept you want to learn about
2. Write out an explanation of the concept in your own words
3. Click submit
4. Review the AI assessment and feedback
5. Iterate on areas highlighted for improvement  
6. Repeat process until achieving a high score
